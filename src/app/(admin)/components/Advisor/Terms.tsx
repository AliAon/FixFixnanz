              <strong>(1)</strong> These General Terms and Conditions are the
              binding rules that apply between Martin Zenner -

              These Terms and Conditions apply to all interested parties and
              entrepreneurs or potential service providers.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>(2)</strong> fixfinanz.de is a platform for customers and
              companies to bring them into contact and promote the generation of
              new customers... . It enables interested users to register via
              fixfinanz.de and arrange consultations. Furthermore, companies
              have the option of operating their own company pages (company
              profile) using the fixfinanz.de platform and using them to
              generate new customers, offer preliminary consultations, arrange
              appointments for these, and create and advertise events. The
              subject of the user agreement with DN is the use of the platform
              to establish contact between potential customers (primarily
              consumers within the meaning of Section 13 of the German Civil
              Code (BGB)) and companies (exclusively entrepreneurs within the
              meaning of Section 14 of the German Civil Code (BGB)). Use of the
              platform requires an internet-enabled device with up-to-date and
              functional browser software.
            </p>

              users, regardless of whether they are entrepreneurs or consumers
              when using the platform. Our Terms and Conditions apply
              exclusively. Any deviating, conflicting, or supplementary general
              terms and conditions of the company will only become part of the
              contract if and to the extent that we have expressly agreed to
              their validity. This requirement of consent applies in all cases.

              <strong>(4)</strong> DN reserves the right to refuse to conclude a
              contract if there are important reasons. Such reasons may exist
              for DN in particular if a conflict of interest exists or may
              arise, or if other legal or statutory reasons preclude this.

              <strong>(1)</strong> To use fixfinanz.de, you must register with a

              address you provided. Use of the platform is possible after
              clicking on the link. Use is free of charge for users. Companies
              can choose between the paid membership packages offered on our
              website.

              <strong>(2)</strong> Each user can only create one user account.
              Transferring these to third parties is not permitted. Users
              undertake to take the necessary measures to ensure the
              confidentiality of their account data and password and to keep
              their password secret. In the event of misuse of the account or
              suspicion of such misuse, or in the event of misuse or loss of the
              password, DN must be notified immediately. In such cases, DN is
              entitled to block the account completely or temporarily.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>(3)</strong> After the platform is activated for use,
              customers can create a non-public customer profile, and companies
              can create a public company profile. All users are obligated to
              provide complete and truthful information. Should users culpably
              provide misleading or false information, they are liable for
              damages to the extent that DN has suffered damage as a result of
              these false statements. Users are further obligated to indemnify
              DN against any third-party claims. Other claims, in particular
              claims for damages from third parties or claims for damages from
              potential contractual partners, remain unaffected.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>(4)</strong> DN will review each company profile before
              publishing it. DN reserves the right to verify individual
              information, for example, by requesting verification from users.
              DN is entitled to refuse to publish user profiles if the profile
              does not correspond to DN&#39;s specialization or if the
              reliability of the information has not been sufficiently proven.
              This also applies if the content to be published violates legal
              requirements, official prohibitions, the rights of third parties,
              common decency, or DN&#39;s Terms and Conditions. DN assumes no
              liability for the information provided by customers or companies.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>(5)</strong> After DN has activated the profile, companies
              have the opportunity to plan and promote events and provide access
              to them to customers. Customers now have access to the company
              profile and can participate in the events or arrange other
              services, such as consultations. Customers and companies then have
              the opportunity to conclude contracts. DN has no connection with
              the offered events, consultations, or concluded contracts and is
              not liable for them or the resulting consequences, nor for the
              content and success of the company&#39;s offers.
