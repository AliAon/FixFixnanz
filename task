Each financial advisor has a fixed industry (Financial Service Category)

The filter function on the "Financial Advisor" page should only display advisors based on their specified industry.

Current Status

In the old FixFinanz (left in the screenshot), the assignment works correctly.
→ Clicking on an industry (e.g., "Insurance") displays only advisors in that industry.

In the new FixFinanz (right in the screenshot), all advisors are currently displayed, regardless of their actual industry.
→ The filter query is not valid or returns incorrect data.

Desired Status

When a visitor selects an industry (checkbox or direct link), only advisors in that industry should appear.
Each advisor is assigned to exactly one main industry (1:1 assignment).
